## Project Status

**Backend Logic**: The core backend functionality is complete, including:

- User authentication and authorization.
    
- CRUD operations for posts and comments.
    
- Likes and follow system.
    
- Profile updates and public/private profiles.
    

**Frontend Design**: The current design is minimal and functional. I ran out of time to enhance the user interface, but all backend logic and APIs are operational.

Feel free to contribute to the design or implement improvements!
